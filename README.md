# Kodi fork for Google Summer of Code 2017 project: Wayland Support

This originally was my fork of Kodi where I coded on my Google Summer of Code 2017 project of adding (back) Wayland support. All work done for GSoC was [merged](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/12664) into Kodi mainline during the final stage of the project. See the updated [README](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/docs/README.linux) for instructions on how to build Kodi for Wayland. Now, this repository is just for my personal development.
